## Consciousness

- "Philosophers have suggested different alternatives: that consciousness should be eliminated from science altogether because it is not a real phenomenon; that consciousness is a real, higher level physical or neurobiological phenomenon; and that consciousness is fundamentally mysterious and beyond human science."
- Hard to define in a way that is amenable to study.

## Consciousness: What, Where, How

### What is Consciousness?

- The mind's subjective experience; the state of being that allows us to subjectively experience the world.
- Philosophy: what does it mean to be conscious?
- Cognitive neuroscience: determine systematic forms of information processing and reproducible class of activation patterns that systematically distinguish 'conscious' mental states from other states.

### Where is the Seat of Consciousness in the Brain?

- What are the **neural correlates of consciousness (NCC)**?

### How Do We Study Consciousness Scientifically?

- Two approaches: **state-based approach** and **content-based approach**.

## State-Based Approach

### What Are Different "States" of Consciousness?

- **Coma**: state of unarousable consciousness, failure of eye movements and motor responses besides simple withdrawal reflexes, no coherent verbal response.
- **Persistent vegetative state/UWS**: unaware of themselves or surrounding, motor responses are not meaningful, state must be present for more than a month.
- **Anesthesia**.
- **Sleep**.
- **Dreaming**.
- **Drunk**.

### How Does the Brain Vary as a Function of "State"?

- What is predictable about the states in the brain that can help us define?

![Reticular Activating System diagram: visual impulses, auditory impulses, and ascending sensory tracts (pain, touch, temperature) feed into reticular formation; ascending arousal projections go to cerebral cortex; descending motor signals go to spinal cord. Illustrates role of the ascending activating system in maintaining consciousness and wakefulness.](images/pdf2-500.png)

**[Video timestamp 19:41–21:50]** Disorder of conscious & without (a big difference in the amount of structural connections).
- Blue: connection across the cortex (frontal lobe most notable).
- Giving rise to functions.

**[Video timestamp 21:50–22:45]** Stimulate the reticular activating system — wakes up the cat.

![Brain imaging comparison of TBI unconscious, TBI conscious, and controls. Upper row (Lower dorsal ARAS): activation maps for each group in the lower dorsal ascending reticular activating system region. Lower row (Upper ARAS): activation maps in the upper ARAS. Unconscious TBI patients show markedly reduced activation in ARAS regions compared to conscious TBI patients and healthy controls.](images/pdf2-501.png)

![Diagram of ascending activating reticular system: brain with highlighted reticular formation (green), arrow labeled "Stimulate" → EEG comparison traces: Sleep (irregular slow-wave activity), Wakefulness (fast regular activity), Stimulation (transition from sleep to wakefulness). Demonstrates that stimulating the reticular system shifts EEG from sleep to wakefulness patterns.](images/pdf2-502.png)

**[To 23:50]** Limitation: necessary but not sufficient.
- (Vegetative state patients and normal individuals may not show any difference.)

**[23:50–28:31]**

### A Challenge to the State-Based Approach

- Our criteria for defining states may not map onto experience!
  - Patient in a persistent vegetative state was more conscious than previously thought.
  - A subsequent study found similar results in ~10% of patients with disorders of consciousness.
  - Able to answer yes/no questions!
- Definition not straightforward!

![Brain imaging study of patients in persistent vegetative state performing mental imagery tasks. Panel A (Patient): activation during Tennis Imagery (SMA region) and Spatial Navigation Imagery (hippocampal/PPA region). Panel B (Controls): similar SMA and PPA activation patterns. Panel C (another Control group): matched activation. Shows that some vegetative patients retain conscious awareness despite behavioral unresponsiveness — no prior instructions condition demonstrates task-relevant activation.](images/pdf2-503.png)

## Content-Based Approach

- [Visual neuroscience approach; a more popular approach.]
- Our awareness of our surroundings is not constant; we all have fluctuations.
- Content-based approach: ask "did you have an experience?"; compare neural activity on "yes" vs. "no" trials.
- The question is whether the participants did or did not have the subjective experience and how the brain activities vary accordingly, despite that the physical stimulations they received were the same.

**[Video timestamp 36:28–45]**

### Subjective Experience & V1

- Subjects detected presence/absence of grating (just at the threshold).

![Two visual stimuli: (c) grating present — concentric sinusoidal rings visible within a noise patch with a central fixation square; (d) grating absent — noise-only patch with a central fixation square. Stimuli are matched in physical energy; subjects must report whether they subjectively perceived the grating.](images/pdf2-504.png)

![Signal detection theory matrix (2×2): Rows = stimulus (present/absent); Columns = response (present/absent). Quadrants: Hit (stimulus present, response present — green), Miss (stimulus present, response absent — orange), False Alarm (stimulus absent, response present — blue), Correct Rejection (stimulus absent, response absent — purple).](images/pdf2-505.png)

## Further Evidence: Late V1 Activity and Conscious Perception

![Two-panel figure (panel b). Left: "Seen figure-present trials" — response strength (Y-axis 0–0.8) over time (0–240 ms) in red; strong early and late sustained response component. Right: "Not seen figure-present trials" — response strength (0–0.8) over time in green; shows only an early transient response, late component absent. Demonstrates that late V1 activity (reentrant feedback) distinguishes consciously seen from unseen trials.](images/pdf2-515.png)

## Binocular Rivalry and Higher-Order Visual Regions

**[Video timestamp 52–1:03]**

- Stimulus: binocular rivalry between face and house.
- Task: indicate percept: face or house.
- Use the same time series.
- Finding: activity in FFA/PPA correspond to experience, despite consistent sensory stimulation.
- NCC = activation of higher order visual regions?

![Binocular rivalry paradigm diagram: (a) Rivalry — overlapping face+house stimulus; percept alternates between face and house icons shown in temporal sequence. (b) Non-Rivalry — Yoked stimulus: same image alternation sequence presented directly (not as rivalry).](images/pdf2-516.png)

![Time-series of % MR Signal (−1 to 3), X-axis = Time (s, 105–195). Red dotted line = FFA; Blue solid line = PPA. "F" labels mark face percept reports; "H" labels mark house percept reports. In the rivalry condition, FFA rises when subject reports face, PPA rises when subject reports house — despite constant retinal input. Fixation control on right side. Demonstrates higher-order visual areas track conscious percept.](images/pdf2-519.png)

![Four panels showing FFA and PPA % MR Signal vs. Time from reported perceptual switch (−8 to +12 sec). (a) Rivalry: House→Face transition — FFA (blue) increases, PPA (red) decreases; Face→House — FFA decreases, PPA increases. (b) Non-Rivalry: same divergence but driven by physical stimulus switch. Demonstrates that in rivalry, subjective experience drives higher-order visual area activity.](images/pdf2-520.png)

## A Challenge to the Content Approach

**[1:03]**

- Our behavioral measure of conscious awareness is necessarily subjective. What if that does not reflect the "objective" state of awareness?
- **Criterion bias**: "conscious" and "unconscious" trials are contaminated in different ways depending on individuals' criterion for reporting "seen" vs. "unseen" (Peters et al., 2016).

![Two overlapping signal strength distributions (frequency vs. signal strength). Top panel — Liberal criterion: criterion line placed left of center; large "reported seen" region includes much of the "unconscious" (blue/purple) distribution alongside the "conscious" (orange) distribution. Bottom panel — Conservative criterion: criterion line placed right of center; some conscious trials fall into "reported unseen" region. Illustrates how criterion placement systematically biases which trials are labeled "conscious" vs. "unconscious."](images/pdf2-521.png)
