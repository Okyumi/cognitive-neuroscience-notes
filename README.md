## Course Description

This course provides students with a broad understanding of the connections between mind, brain, and behavior. Students learn dominant theories of the neural basis of a variety of cognitive processes and the research that led to those theories. Topics are organized into modules on sensation, perception, and action; attention and memory; and other aspects of high-level cognition and behavior.
