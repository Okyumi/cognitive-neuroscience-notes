# Cognitive Neuroscience Notes

**Course**: PSYCH-UH 2412 Cognitive Neuroscience  
**Institution**: New York University Abu Dhabi  
**Authors**: Sean Shan Guangji & Yumi Omori  
**Semester**: Fall 2021

## Course Description

This course provides students with a broad understanding of the connections between mind, brain, and behavior. Students learn dominant theories of the neural basis of a variety of cognitive processes and the research that led to those theories. Topics are organized into modules on sensation, perception, and action; attention and memory; and other aspects of high-level cognition and behavior. Lectures are complemented by practical lab demonstrations of cutting-edge cognitive neuroscience techniques and discussions of journal articles.
