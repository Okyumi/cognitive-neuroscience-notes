## Paper 3: Insensitivity to Future Consequences Following Damage to Human Prefrontal Cortex

*(Chinese title: Insensitivity to future consequences following damage to human prefrontal cortex — Insensitivity to future outcomes following damage to the human prefrontal cortex)*

## Critique / Critical Evaluation

**Regarding sample size:** Small. Regarding the age range of subjects: it differs between conditions. Will this cause imprecise results?

No. Regardless of whether it is the number of subjects or the age range, different types of experiments have different requirements.

For this type of biological (physiological, anatomical, etc.) experiment, we do not need more different subjects to emphasize something we have already verified and inferred. (For example, we don't need to dissect 1000 people to prove that all humans have 2 lungs.)

**Important extension:** When studying lesions in monkeys, the sample size is generally 2. The rationale is as follows:

Find biological proof in the first monkey, then replicate in the second monkey. If the results are consistent, this is already extremely convincing.

**The key problem of this paper: Circular reasoning (circulatory reasoning).**

When selecting subjects, the authors searched for patients who were "insensitive to future outcomes following prefrontal lesions," and ultimately proved that "prefrontal lesions lead to insensitivity to future outcomes."

When selecting subjects (especially subjects with brain damage, because they are difficult to find), experimenters must make their selections blindfolded — that is, without prior knowledge of the condition.

This is not outcome-oriented reasoning, but process-oriented reasoning. If the selection is made without prior knowledge (prefrontal lobe damaged, but not knowing whether they are insensitive to future outcomes), and if the same batch of subjects is ultimately selected and the same conclusions are reached, this does not prove any problem with the experimental method. It is simply that the author's selection approach is not accepted.

The authors should have stated the time at which the brain injury in subjects had already occurred before they participated in the experiment — because humans have neural plasticity, not specifying the time may introduce confounding variables.

One advantage of this experiment is that the authors used patients with damage in other areas of the brain (alongside normal subjects as controls) to create two comparison groups, thus excluding the possibility that damage to other parts of the brain caused the experimental results. However, this approach is still not satisfactory — the authors should have tried as much as possible to control the size of brain damage (although this is very difficult), otherwise confounding variables would be introduced.

One characteristic of this report is that the authors presented entirely new viewpoints in the discussion. This is not recommended. However, it is also not something that warrants severe criticism.

## Dissociation-Related Concepts

**Using this experiment as an example:** insensitivity to future outcomes may be due to impaired decision-making function as mentioned in the paper, but it may also be due to other reasons, such as impaired working memory. The authors have an obligation to further distinguish between these possibilities, or to propose them as future research directions.

### Single Dissociation

> Area 1 has function A but not function B.

In the example just given: if the authors demonstrated that the prefrontal lesion area in the experiment is related to decision-making but not to working memory, this would provide a **single dissociation**, making the experimental conclusions more rigorous.

### Double Dissociation

> Area 1 has function A but not function B, and area 2 has function B but not function A.

In the example just given: if the authors not only demonstrated that the prefrontal lesion area is responsible for decision-making rather than working memory, but also that another area of the brain is responsible for working memory rather than decision-making — this would be a **double dissociation**, which carries the strongest evidentiary force and is more rigorous.
