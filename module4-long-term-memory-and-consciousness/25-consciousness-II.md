## Continuation: Content-Based Approach — V1 Activity and Conscious Perception

### Signal Detection Framework

*Signal detection theory matrix (2×2): Rows = stimulus (present/absent); Columns = response (present/absent). Quadrants: Hit (stimulus present, response present — green), Miss (stimulus present, response absent — orange), False Alarm (stimulus absent, response present — blue), Correct Rejection (stimulus absent, response absent — purple).*

- **V1 activity was higher for hits vs. correct rejection.**
- **V1 activity was also higher for false alarms vs. misses.** [bold activation]


- If bottom up, low activity in false alarm; if top down, high activity in false alarm.
- Follow what we think is happening rather than what is actually happening. [Taking about awareness]

**再听47:50-52**

- Difference: whether the stimulus show up.

Left: "Seen figure-present trials" — response strength (Y-axis 0–0.8) over Time (0–240 ms); red curve shows strong early and sustained late response. Right: "Not seen figure-present trials" — response strength (0–0.8) over Time; green curve shows only an early transient peak without a late component. Demonstrates that only late V1 activity (reentrant feedback) distinguishes consciously seen from unseen trials." width="600">

- **Only late V1 activity showed a difference between seen and unseen trials.**
- **NCC = reentrant activity to V1?**
- v1 not feed for but feedback.

## Binocular Rivalry and Higher-Order Visual Regions

**[Video timestamp 52–1:03]**

- Stimulus: binocular rivalry between face and house.
- Task: indicate percept: face or house.
- Use the same time series.
- Finding: activity in FFA/PPA correspond to experience, despite consistent sensory stimulation.
- NCC = activation of higher order visual regions?

<p align="center">
  <img src="../images/pdf2-530.png" alt="Time-series graph (% MR Signal, Y-axis −1 to +3) over Time (s, 105–195). Red dotted line = FFA signal; Blue solid line = PPA signal. "F" labels mark moments when subject reports face percept; "H" labels mark house percept. In the Rivalry condition, FFA rises during face percept and PPA rises during house percept — despite constant retinal stimulation. Fixation control period shown on right." width="600">

## A Challenge to the Content Approach

**[1:03]**

- Our behavioral measure of conscious awareness is necessarily subjective. What if that does not reflect the "objective" state of awareness?
- **Criterion bias**: "conscious" and "unconscious" trials are contaminated in different ways depending on individuals' criterion for reporting "seen" vs. "unseen" (peters et al., 2016).

<p align="center">
  <img src="../images/pdf2-536.png" alt="Two overlapping distributions showing criterion bias. Top panel — Liberal criterion: the criterion line is placed to the left; a large portion of the "unconscious" (blue/purple) distribution falls into the "reported seen" region alongside the "conscious" (orange) distribution. Bottom panel — Conservative criterion: the criterion line is placed to the right; some conscious trials fall into the "reported unseen" region. X-axis: signal strength. Y-axis: frequency. Illustrates how individuals' criterion placement systematically biases which trials are labeled "conscious" vs. "unconscious," contaminating the comparison." width="600">
