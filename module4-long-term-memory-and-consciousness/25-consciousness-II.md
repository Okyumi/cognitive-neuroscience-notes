## Neural Theories of Consciousness

### Global Workspace Theory (GWT)

- Baars (1988); Dehaene & Changeux (2011).
- Metaphor: a **theater** — consciousness is like a spotlight on a stage; only what is in the spotlight is conscious.
- Key idea: a **global workspace** — a network of neurons (primarily in prefrontal and parietal cortex) that can broadcast information widely across the brain.
  - Unconscious processing: modular, local, parallel — information is processed in specialized modules but not broadcast.
  - Conscious processing: global broadcast — information is amplified and broadcast to many brain areas simultaneously.
- **Neural signature:** "ignition" — a sudden, widespread activation of frontoparietal networks when a stimulus crosses the threshold of consciousness.

### Integrated Information Theory (IIT)

- Tononi (2004, 2008).
- Consciousness is identical to integrated information, quantified as **Φ (phi)**.
- Key ideas:
  - Consciousness requires **integration**: the information generated by the whole system must be more than the sum of its parts.
  - Consciousness requires **information**: the system must be in a specific state out of many possible states.
- **Phi (Φ):** a mathematical measure of how much information is generated by the integrated system above and beyond its parts.
  - High Φ: highly conscious (e.g., awake human brain).
  - Low Φ: less conscious or unconscious (e.g., deep sleep, simple feedforward networks).
- **Implication:** any physical system with high Φ is conscious, to some degree — including non-biological systems.

### Comparison: GWT vs. IIT

| | GWT | IIT |
|---|---|---|
| **Core claim** | Consciousness = global broadcast | Consciousness = integrated information (Φ) |
| **Key brain regions** | Prefrontal + parietal cortex | Posterior cortex (especially parieto-occipital) |
| **Mechanism** | Ignition and broadcasting | Integration and differentiation |
| **Predicts consciousness in** | Systems with a global workspace | Any system with high Φ |
| **Testable predictions** | Frontoparietal ignition at threshold | Measure Φ; perturbational complexity index (PCI) |

### Signal Detection Theory (SDT)

- A framework for separating **sensitivity** (d') from **response bias** (criterion, c).
- Key concepts:
  - **Hit:** stimulus present, participant says "yes".
  - **Miss:** stimulus present, participant says "no".
  - **False alarm:** stimulus absent, participant says "yes".
  - **Correct rejection:** stimulus absent, participant says "no".
- **d' (d-prime):** the distance between the signal+noise and noise distributions, in units of standard deviation.
  - Measures sensitivity, independent of bias.
- **Criterion (c):** the threshold for responding "yes".
  - Reflects the participant's response strategy (liberal vs. conservative).

### Why Use SDT for Consciousness Research?

- In consciousness experiments, we often want to know: is the participant truly not perceiving the stimulus, or are they just being conservative in their response?
- SDT separates these:
  - A participant with low d' truly cannot detect the stimulus.
  - A participant with high criterion (conservative bias) can detect the stimulus but chooses not to report it.
- This is important for interpreting results of threshold and masking paradigms.
