## Consciousness

- "Philosophers have suggested different alternatives: that consciousness should be eliminated from science altogether because it is not a real phenomenon, but an illusion or a convenient fiction; or that it may be a real phenomenon but not a natural one (and hence outside the scope of a scientific analysis); or that it may be both real and natural, but identical to, or at least supervenient on, some physical process."

- Consciousness is what we are, what we experience, how we interpret and engage with the world.

## Approaches

- **Philosophical:**
  - The hard problem of consciousness (Chalmers, 1995): Why does physical processing in the brain give rise to subjective experience (qualia)?
  - The easy problems: Explaining the mechanisms of perception, attention, memory, report — things we can operationalize.
  - The hard problem: Why is there "something it is like" to have these experiences?

- **Psychological:**
  - Behavioral and cognitive correlates of consciousness.
  - What are the psychological conditions under which people are conscious vs. not conscious of a stimulus?

- **Neural:**
  - Neural correlates of consciousness (NCC): the minimal neural mechanisms sufficient for a conscious percept.
  - What brain activity distinguishes conscious from unconscious processing?

## Neural Correlates of Consciousness (NCC)

- **Goal:** identify the minimal neural mechanisms that are sufficient for conscious experience.
- **Method:** compare neural activity when a stimulus is consciously perceived vs. not perceived.
  - Paradigms that create variability in perception while keeping the physical stimulus constant.

## Paradigms for Studying Consciousness

### Binocular Rivalry

- Present different images to each eye simultaneously.
- Perception alternates between the two images (rather than seeing a blend).
- The physical stimulus is constant; the percept changes.
- This dissociation allows researchers to identify neural activity that tracks the percept, not just the stimulus.

### Masking

- A target stimulus is briefly presented and then immediately followed by a masking stimulus.
- If the mask is strong enough, the target is not consciously perceived.
- Allows comparison of neural responses to seen vs. unseen stimuli.

### Threshold Stimuli

- Present stimuli near the detection threshold.
- On some trials, the participant reports perceiving the stimulus; on others, they do not (even though the stimulus was physically identical or similar).
- Compare neural activity for detected vs. undetected trials.
