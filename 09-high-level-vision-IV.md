## Scene Perception

### What is a Scene?

- A **scene** is a spatially coherent arrangement of objects and surfaces.
- Scene recognition is **fast** (~100 ms) and **parallel** (gist perception).

### Parahippocampal Place Area (PPA)

- Epstein & Kanwisher (1998): right parahippocampal gyrus responds more to **places/scenes** than faces or objects.
- Responds to **spatial layout** (geometry of a room) independent of individual objects in the scene.

### Retrosplenial Cortex (RSC) and Occipital Place Area (OPA)

- **RSC**: involved in landmark recognition and navigation; links scenes to memory.
- **OPA**: involved in real-time perception of navigable space.

## Visual Cortex Retinotopic Organization

- Early visual areas (V1–V4) are **retinotopically organized**: adjacent positions in the visual field are represented in adjacent cortical positions.

### Eccentricity Mapping

- **Foveal** stimuli → posterior/medial visual cortex.
- **Peripheral** stimuli → anterior/lateral visual cortex.
- **Cortical magnification factor**: disproportionately more cortex devoted to the fovea.

### Polar Angle Mapping

- Upper visual field → lower bank of the calcarine sulcus.
- Lower visual field → upper bank of the calcarine sulcus.

## Visual Field Defects from V1 Lesions

- Lesion of left V1 → **right homonymous hemianopia** (loss of right visual field in both eyes).
- Lesion of upper bank of left calcarine → **right lower quadrantanopia**.
- Lesion of foveal representation → **central scotoma**.

## The Ventral vs. Dorsal Stream

### Ventral Stream ("What")

- V1 → V2 → V4 → Lateral Occipital (LO) → IT (Inferotemporal cortex)
- Function: object recognition, face recognition, scene recognition.

### Dorsal Stream ("Where/How")

- V1 → V2 → V5/MT → Posterior Parietal Cortex (PPC)
- Function: spatial processing, visually guided action, motion perception.

### Double Dissociation Evidence

- **Visual form agnosia** (ventral damage): cannot recognize objects, but can use visual info to guide actions (reaching, grasping).
- **Optic ataxia** (dorsal damage): cannot use visual info to guide actions, but can recognize objects.

## Spatial Frequency and Visual Processing

### What is Spatial Frequency?

- Number of cycles per degree of visual angle.
- **Low spatial frequency (LSF)**: coarse information (overall shape, gist).
- **High spatial frequency (HSF)**: fine detail (texture, edges).

### Processing Channels

- **Magnocellular (M) pathway**: fast, low spatial frequency, motion sensitive.
- **Parvocellular (P) pathway**: slow, high spatial frequency, color sensitive.

## Perceptual Learning

- Practice improves perceptual performance (e.g., texture discrimination).
- Learning can be **specific** to the trained stimulus and location.
- Involves plasticity in early visual areas (V1, V2).

## Summary of Visual Cortex Areas

| Area | Main Function |
|------|---------------|
| V1 | Primary visual cortex; orientation, spatial frequency, color, binocular disparity |
| V2 | Processes complex stimuli, illusory contours |
| V3 | Form, some motion |
| V4 | Color, form |
| V5/MT | Motion, optic flow |
| LO | Object recognition |
| FFA | Face recognition |
| PPA | Scene/place recognition |
| EBA | Body perception |
| VWFA | Visual word form |
| IT | High-level object recognition |

## Paper 7: The Parahippocampal Place Area (Epstein & Kanwisher, 1998)

### Key Findings

- PPA responds more to scenes (rooms, landscapes) than to faces or objects.
- Specifically responds to the **spatial layout** of scenes, not just the presence of objects.
- Right-lateralized.

### Methods

- fMRI block design.
- Stimuli: photographs of rooms (with and without objects), isolated objects, faces.

### Critique

- Block design: confounds scene-specific processing with sustained attention/arousal effects.
- Small n, ROI analysis only.
- Later studies showed PPA also responds to isolated objects that are strongly associated with places (e.g., a mailbox).

## The "Scene-Selective" Network

- PPA + RSC + OPA form a network for scene processing.
- Each area has a different functional role:
  - **PPA**: layout/geometry.
  - **RSC**: navigation/memory.
  - **OPA**: real-time navigation.
