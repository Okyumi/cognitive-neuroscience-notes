## Paper 7: Anticipatory Biasing of Visuospatial Attention Indexed by Retinotopically Specific α-Band Electroencephalography Increases over Occipital Cortex

*(Original title in Chinese: 视觉空间的注意力的预期偏向由视网膜上特定的α波段脑电图指示，在枕叶皮层上增加)*

- Covert attention = Endogenous attention (directly willfully), nothing stimulus salient.
- Why? Process relevant from irrelevant.
- Indicate the orientation only at the attended side.

**Which part important?**

We mainly care about the delay part – alpha stimulus before the onset of stimulus (though there is also data in the delay before next trial).

Panel B shows the timing diagram with Cue, Orientation Stimulus OR Motion Stimulus, and a 1000ms delay interval." width="600">

*Experimental paradigm: Panel A shows Cue (35ms) → Delay (1000ms) → Stimulus (85ms) → Delay Before Next Trial (1500-3000ms). Cue Right (50%) leads to Left Stimulus (50%), and Cue Left (50%) leads to Right Stimulus (50%). Panel B shows the timing diagram with Cue, Orientation Stimulus OR Motion Stimulus, and a 1000ms delay interval.*

**Gating effect?** What gets in & What gets out (allow something to process more/less).

**Data: where do the alpha waves come from?**

It is not the brain activity; it is the amplitude of the alpha.

## M/EEG Demonstration

Because there is liquid helium inside the MEG, it's extremely expensive…… therefore many universities only have EEG but not MEG. Once again I feel that having money is really good, and you need to stand up straight." — Photos showing the MEG machine at NYU Abu Dhabi on December 7, 2018 and October 12, 2021." width="600">
