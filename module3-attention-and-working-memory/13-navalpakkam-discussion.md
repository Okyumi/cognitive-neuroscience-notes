## Paper 8: Top-down attention selection is fine grained

*(Original title in Chinese: 自上而下的注意力选择是细化的)*

### Summary

- **Goal:** granularity of top-down attention signals
- top-down = endogenous attention
- bottom-up = exogenous attention
- Understanding granularity: 1. precision; 2. dimension / feature (in general or more precise)
- 25 Ls on the screen
- In each category within a dimension: 1. intensity (luminance), 2. size, 3. saturation
- Find & report numbers
- [Do calculations, different from using *catch trials*]
- Coarse guidance will be boosting all of the distributions equally
- Fine-grained guidance will be boosting one at a time.
- (Problem of **linear separability**: boost high or boost low)
- Measure the fixation and RT (but the RT is uninteresting to us)
- # fixations → top down
- (Number of fixations on the specific intensity that the target is going to be in)
- (Graph – bar: the number of fixations on that intensity)

Panel (b) fine top-down guidance — signal diagram showing only MID intensity node receiving attention weight, three sample search displays, and bar graph of # fixations showing a tall green (MID) bar and short blue (LOW) and dark red (HIGH) bars." width="600">

### Some critiques

- Doing the task for 3 days & only 200 trials in an hour is very slow;
- Did not mention counterbalancing the order; (think about: how could that potentially be a problem)
- Did not clearly mention the location of targets; (hope to be randomized)
- Did not elaborate on the **speed-accuracy trade-off** (speed ↑, accuracy ↓; speed ↓, accuracy ↑) → rule out possibilities of shifting strategy. In this type of task, we do not want people to shift strategy in the middle.
  (Only when speed and accuracy both improves are attention or WM, otherwise it is shifting strategy)

### Results

- Subject size (having 3 subjects) is not ideal.
  (Despite that it can generalize because it is a low-level processing which is not likely to be affected by population.)

Middle row — three grouped bar graphs (# fixations for Subject 1, Subject 2, Subject 3), with bars colored blue (LOW), green (MID), dark red (HIGH); asterisks mark significant differences. Bottom row — three line graphs showing % fixations on relevant cue (0–100%) vs. time (units of block number), one graph per intensity condition." width="600">

- The graph in the middle is the most important: rule out the linear separability.

- Graphs in the last row: one additional feature – time. Pattern consistent overtime.
- Critique: in mid, there is a little bit more but not much more than 1/3.
- Parallel: search the whole field at once (RT does not change with # items).
- Serial: search one item at a time (the more item you add, the longer time it takes).
- Critique: shape is also different (as a confound).
- Better way: e.g., when we are examining the intensity dimension and looking at the mid, we can also have different shapes in low and high.
