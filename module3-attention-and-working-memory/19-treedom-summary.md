## Comparative Table of the 3 Recent Papers

| | **Anticipatory biasing of visuospatial attention indexed by retinotopically specific alpha band EEG increases over occipital cortex** | **Top-down attention selection is fine grained** | **Mnemonic coding of visual space in the monkey's dorsolateral prefrontal cortex** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Test subjects** | Human | Human | Monkey |
| **Method** | EEG | Eye-tracking | Single-unit recording |
| **Brain area recorded** | Occipital cortex | N.A. (eye) | Prefrontal cortex within and surrounding principal sulcus (DLPFC) |
| **Task** | One stimulus was designated as the target – fixation – cue direction to attend to – if the target was detected press button | Take luminance as example: there are three conditions – low mid low – for each condition the target would appear in the respective luminance interval, participants know ahead of time which condition they will be tested on. There are 25 (8 in each interval) Ls plus one upside down L target in the tested interval. Subjects need to find it. Researchers trace their eye movements and record eye fixations. | Fixation point – stimulus in one of 8/4 locations while eye fixated – delay – when fixation disappears make eye movement to the location that's asked to remember – reward – ITI |
| **Main conclusion** | Sustained focal increases of a band activity were seen over occipital cortex contralateral to the ignored location (ipsilateral to the cued direction of attention) | Top-down attention selection is fine-grained | Monkeys show directionally specific delay period activity. The brain stores info is by letting one neuron tuned to a specific direction keep firing in the delay period when remember the specific preferred direction presented. |
| **Main critique** | Didn't design neutral trials? No neural-type tests conducted? (没有做神经类测试？) | The sensory input between the target and the rest of the stimuli is not all same (except the tested dimension), because the shape of the target stimuli is different. It could be fixed by having some upside-down Ls in other feature intervals. Because subjects can just ignore the luminance feature dimension and search for the upside-down shape but the data is not telling us this way. (Besides the tested variable, the orientation of the L is also different. 除了测试的变量，L的方向也不同) | Although both can be seen as WM it is hard to tell that the monkey is maintaining the past/retrospective representation of the position/direction but instead they could be maintaining prospective intention of eye movement. We can furtherly test by including a visually guided eye saccade before they make the final eyes saccade to the remembered location. In this way maintaining the future intention of eye saccade is useless as you don't know where is the start point of the eye saccade. Or simply design a match response task where they need to press the button instead of moving their eyes. (Retrospective memory vs. prospective action? 回顾记忆 vs. 预期行为？) |

## Additional Critiques (Continued)

| | **Anticipatory biasing of visuospatial attention (EEG)** | **Top-down attention selection is fine grained (Eye-tracking)** | **Mnemonic coding of visual space (Single-unit recording)** |
|---|---|---|---|
| | | There are such small number of eye fixation before they actually find the target (3 in 25) even in the target interval it is still few (3 in 8) which somehow suggest the upside-down shape would somehow pops out in a parallel search. (Too few fixation points, may be parallel processing. 视点太少，可能是平行处理) | We cannot be sure whether they are remembering or storing info or just sustaining their attention in the location. To improve this, we can insert an attention demanding task in the delay. (Is it working memory or attention? 是工作记忆还是注意力) |
| | | They didn't show what would happen in absence of any attention. (Didn't show the results of absence of attention. 未展示注意力缺失的结果) | They didn't specify if the identified 200 neurons are from one monkey or several monkeys. It matters even more when the number of neurons narrows down to 20ish because if it comes from one monkey then the result might not be generalized. (Didn't specify which monkey, generalizability questionable. 未说明来自哪个猴子，泛化性存疑) |
| | | They didn't define clearly what is coarse-grained – intervals within a dimension all boosted equally or linear separability between response and correct answer. (Didn't clearly define coarse-grained processing. 未清晰定义粗略处理) | The design/analysis make binary response. To improve this, we can measure continuously of angle between response and correct answer. (Too much binary measurement/analysis. 二元的测量分析过多) |
| | | When they talk about rejected trials they talk in percentage and we don't know whether these percentages are overlapping or not. (Details of rejected trials not specified. 弃置实验组未说明细节) | Although our behavior output is deterministic it is possible that there is a part of the brain doing the weighting of all info sent by different neurons. (The brain may weight. 大脑可能加权) |
| | | Many blinks removed from analysis too subjective hard to copy. (Discarding blink trials too subjective. 弃置眨眼组过于主观) | |
| **Main limitation** | General limitation of EEG: although we don't need to know where it is from and we only care about the difference in activity of a band, still, we can't know the source of the activity. It is not a problem because the way they select electrodes is not by firstly detecting there is difference in an activity and chose them. (EEG has low spatial resolution. EEG空间分辨率低) | How fine grain attention can be and can three intervals in a feature dimension really get defined as "fine-grained"? (Three levels = fine-grained processing? 三个等级就是细致处理？) | The way they analyze data is by looking at it in a labeled-lined way instead of population coding, it is not optimal because although some show directionally specific activity it is broadly tuned to multiple directions. (Not necessarily labeled-line coding, may be population coding. 不一定是标线编码，可能群体编码) |
| | No difference between band activity between task motion and direction. They should be different as our visual cortex is spatial-topographically organized. [Dorsal vs ventral.] (Motion and direction should differ. 动态和方向理应有区别) | | General limitation of single unit recording: it is a sample of convenience there is a whole lot more in the neurons we don't have access to. (SNR; not recording all neurons. SNR并非记录所有神经元) |
| | | | The neurons tuned to specific directions only after they trained them for a very long period of time on very limited number of things so the way monkey now encode the info might be different than they would in nature. (Monkeys were overtrained. 猴子被过度训练) |
| **Why this study is important** | This study wants to understand changes in a band (inhibitory processing) during the anticipatory deployment of attention to visual spaces. Attention helps us survive and it is important to know how we drive our attention. | Attention is important to survival. | This is one of the first papers to address that delay activity has something to do with storage because the firing during delay period represents the info that's stored (direction selectivity). Spatial WM is important to evolution. We previously didn't know whether delay activity is storing or is for other things. |
