## Continuation: Content-Based Approach — V1 Activity and Conscious Perception

### Signal Detection Framework

![Signal detection theory matrix (2×2): Rows = stimulus (present/absent); Columns = response (present/absent). Quadrants: Hit (stimulus present, response present — green), Miss (stimulus present, response absent — orange), False Alarm (stimulus absent, response present — blue), Correct Rejection (stimulus absent, response absent — purple).](images/pdf2-526.png)

- **V1 activity was higher for hits vs. correct rejection.**
- **V1 activity was also higher for false alarms vs. misses.** [bold activation]

![Panel a (Subject DJH): BOLD signal (% signal change, Y-axis −0.3 to 0.3) over Time (0–12 sec). Filled squares line = Hits — peaks at ~+0.17 near 6 sec. Open squares line = Misses/False alarms — dips to ~−0.1. Caption: [bold activation]. Demonstrates V1 BOLD is higher when subjects report "seen" (both hits and false alarms), regardless of whether a stimulus was physically present. Panel b shows corresponding data.](images/pdf2-527.png)

- If bottom up, low activity in false alarm; if top down, high activity in false alarm.
- Follow what we think is happening rather than what is actually happening. [Taking about awareness]

**[Re-listen 47:50–52]**

- Difference: whether the stimulus shows up.

![Panel b — Two-plot figure. Left: "Seen figure-present trials" — response strength (Y-axis 0–0.8) over Time (0–240 ms); red curve shows strong early and sustained late response. Right: "Not seen figure-present trials" — response strength (0–0.8) over Time; green curve shows only an early transient peak without a late component. Demonstrates that only late V1 activity (reentrant feedback) distinguishes consciously seen from unseen trials.](images/pdf2-528.png)

- **Only late V1 activity showed a difference between seen and unseen trials.**
- **NCC = reentrant activity to V1?**
- V1: not feedforward but feedback.

## Binocular Rivalry and Higher-Order Visual Regions

**[Video timestamp 52–1:03]**

- Stimulus: binocular rivalry between face and house.
- Task: indicate percept: face or house.
- Use the same time series.
- Finding: activity in FFA/PPA correspond to experience, despite consistent sensory stimulation.
- NCC = activation of higher order visual regions?

![Binocular rivalry paradigm: (a) Rivalry — superimposed face+house images; percept alternates between face and house icons shown in sequence. (b) Non-Rivalry — Yoked stimulus: same image alternation sequence presented directly without rivalry. Time axis shown at bottom.](images/pdf2-529.png)

![Time-series graph (% MR Signal, Y-axis −1 to +3) over Time (s, 105–195). Red dotted line = FFA signal; Blue solid line = PPA signal. "F" labels mark moments when subject reports face percept; "H" labels mark house percept. In the Rivalry condition, FFA rises during face percept and PPA rises during house percept — despite constant retinal stimulation. Fixation control period shown on right.](images/pdf2-530.png)

![Four panels: (a) Rivalry — House→Face transition: FFA (blue) increases, PPA (red) decreases over time from reported perceptual switch (−8 to +12 sec). Face→House: FFA decreases, PPA increases. (b) Non-Rivalry — same divergence pattern driven by physical stimulus switch rather than subjective percept switch. Y-axis: % MR Signal (0–1.0). Demonstrates that in rivalry, subjective perception (not physical stimulus) drives higher-order visual area activity.](images/pdf2-531.png)

## A Challenge to the Content Approach

**[1:03]**

- Our behavioral measure of conscious awareness is necessarily subjective. What if that does not reflect the "objective" state of awareness?
- **Criterion bias**: "conscious" and "unconscious" trials are contaminated in different ways depending on individuals' criterion for reporting "seen" vs. "unseen" (Peters et al., 2016).

![Two overlapping distributions showing criterion bias. Top panel — Liberal criterion: the criterion line is placed to the left; a large portion of the "unconscious" (blue/purple) distribution falls into the "reported seen" region alongside the "conscious" (orange) distribution. Bottom panel — Conservative criterion: the criterion line is placed to the right; some conscious trials fall into the "reported unseen" region. X-axis: signal strength. Y-axis: frequency. Illustrates how individuals' criterion placement systematically biases which trials are labeled "conscious" vs. "unconscious," contaminating the comparison.](images/pdf2-536.png)

![Frequency distribution plot comparing conscious trials (orange line) vs. unconscious trials (dark blue line). X-axis: Error (degrees, −180 to 180). Y-axis: Frequency (0–0.150). Conscious trials cluster sharply near 0 error, showing precise orientation discrimination; unconscious trials are broadly distributed across error values, indicating random/chance-level responses. Demonstrates objective psychophysical evidence differentiating conscious from unconscious perception.](images/pdf2-537.png)
