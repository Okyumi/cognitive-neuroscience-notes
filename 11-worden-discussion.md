## Paper 9: Anticipatory Biasing of Visuospatial Attention Indexed by Retinotopically Specific Alpha-Band Electroencephalography Increases over Occipital, Parietal, and Frontal Cortex

---

## Summary

- Worden et al. (2000) used EEG to show that **alpha power** (8–12 Hz) over **occipital** regions reflects **anticipatory spatial attention**.
- When subjects expected a target at a cued location:
  - Alpha **decreased** (desynchronized) **contralateral** to the cued location (= facilitated processing).
  - Alpha **increased** (synchronized) **ipsilateral** to the cued location (= suppressed processing).
- This alpha lateralization preceded the target onset.

## Critical Evaluation

### Strength 1: Retinotopically specific

- Alpha effects were specific to the hemisphere contralateral to the cued location — confirms spatial specificity.

### Strength 2: Anticipatory

- Alpha lateralization occurred **before** the target appeared — demonstrates **predictive** attentional modulation, not just response to stimulus.

### Strength 3: Clean design

- Separate cue and target epochs; long cue-target interval (1000 ms) allows clear separation of anticipatory activity.

### Limitation 1: Correlational

- EEG records correlates of attention, not causal mechanism.
- Does not prove alpha suppression **causes** better perception.

### Limitation 2: Source localization

- EEG has poor spatial resolution; cannot definitively localize alpha to occipital vs. parietal vs. frontal sources without source modeling.

### Limitation 3: Small N

- Only 6 subjects; results should be replicated with larger samples.

## Connecting to Lecture Material

- Alpha as **active suppression** vs. passive idling ("idle rhythm" hypothesis).
- Supports **biased competition** model: attention biases processing in favor of attended location via alpha suppression of unattended locations.
- Relates to the **N2pc** component: while alpha reflects sustained preparatory attention, N2pc reflects the moment of target selection.
