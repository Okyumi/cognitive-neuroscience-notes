## Sensation vs. Perception

- **Sensation**: the process by which the nervous system receives and represents physical stimulus energy.
- **Perception**: the process of organizing, interpreting, and consciously experiencing signals from our environment.
- Receiving and encoding information vs. Interpreting and experiencing that information.

---

## Sensory Systems

- (Some of) the problems a sensory system has to solve:

### Differentiate between physical stimuli.

- Different types of physical stimuli activate different types of specialized receptors.
  - Each receptor responds to one type of stimulus energy.
    - Rods & Cones in retina → Light.
    - Taste buds on tongue → Chemicals.
- Different sensations are carried to the brain via different pathways.
- Different sensations are processed by different parts of the brain.

### Localize a physical stimulus.

- How do we localize stimuli in space?
  - **Spatial receptive fields**: receptors and neurons respond to sensations in a specific area of space.
    - Touch receptors.
    - Photoreceptors.

  - Receptive fields have a center and size. (The smaller the receptive size, the higher the acuity.)

### Represent the intensity of a physical stimulus.

## Perception as an Inference

- **Inference**: a conclusion reached on the basis of evidence and reasoning.
- "Seeing is not a direct apprehension of reality, as we often like to pretend. quite the contrary: seeing is an inference from incomplete information." —e.t. Jaynes
- When we perceive, we combine the evidence (incomplete information) with our prior knowledge of the world.

- Example: the directionality of the visual pathway—there are more fibers carrying information against the flow of information (in the reverse direction) which is probably because the cortex influences the lower-level region and modifies the information that is being stored and transmitted from the retina to the cortex.

## Dorsal & Ventral Streams

*Diagram of dorsal and ventral visual pathways showing Retina, LGN, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5/MT, MST, V3a, IPL, SPL, IT*

- What information is processed in each stream?
  - **Ventral**: complex object information.
  - **Dorsal**: spatial information, location, movement.
  - What vs. Where (Ungerleider & Mishkin, 1982)
  - "Vision for perception" vs. "Vision for action" (Goodale & Milner, 1992)

- Evidence from brain damage:
  - **Hemispatial neglect**: damage to parietal lobe (dorsal stream).

  - Missing out the left part.

- **Patient DF**: damage to ventral stream.

*Patient DF brain lesions (top-left MRI scans); perceptual orientation matching task vs. visuomotor "posting" task for DF and control*

  - Left: perceptual orientation matching task (understanding orientation);
  - Right: put the card in the slot (practicing action).

- Evidence from neurophysiological data: dissociation of information processing.
  - **Middle temporal area (area MT)**: motion direction preference. (The left graph)
  - **Inferior temporal cortex (IT cortex)**: cortices and faces. (The two right graphs)

  - Eyes are definitely important, but the holistic configuration is more important. There is nothing to do with the familiarity (no firing for hands).
  - Properties of IT neurons:
    - Preference for faces & face-like objects.
    - Size invariance. (It does not matter for the size of the face.)
    - Position invariance. (It does not matter if rotating the face along the axis.)
    - Category vs. Token/Exemplar? (Is responding generally to faces or differentiating different faces?)

## Paper 5: Separate Visual Pathways for Perception and Action (Perception and Action: Separate Visual Pathways)

**Summary**

**In 1982:**

| Name | Pathway | Function | Lesion |
|------|---------|----------|--------|
| Ventral stream | Striate cortex → Inferotemporal cortex | Objects' qualities | Visual pattern discrimination and recognition |
| Dorsal stream | Striate cortex → Posterior parietal cortex | Objects' spatial location | Solving landmark tasks |

**Now:**

Temporal and parietal lobes could both be involved in shape analysis but associated with different strategies.

| Name | Function | Summary | Elaboration |
|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| Ventral stream | Vision for perception: perceptual identification for objects | Object-centered | Consistencies of shape, size, color, lightness, and location need to be maintained across different viewing conditions. |
| Dorsal stream | Vision for action: mediate the required sensorimotor transformations for visually guided actions directed at objects | Viewer-centered | Location of the object. Object's particular deposition and motion with respect to the viewer (egocentric coordinates). |
