- A comparison of the amplitudes and durations of electric potentials recorded from the scalp (electroencephalogram or EEG) or surface of the cortex (electrocorticogram or ECoG) with macroelectrodes, or adjacent to or within single neurons with microelectrodes. The potentials detected with macroelectrodes tend to be dominated by extracellular currents arising from comparatively long duration (10–1000 ms) postsynaptic potentials in neurons or events of similar duration in glial cells, whereas microelectrodes can also detect rapid changes in membrane potential in adjacent neurons or axons, such as action potentials or unit "spikes."

- In general, the recording adjacent to neurons enable more general measurements, whereas the recording within neurons could give rise to more specific measurements and even make a cell fire.

## Whole-Cell Recording or Whole-Cell Patch

- Whole-cell recordings involve recording currents through multiple channels simultaneously, over a large region of the cell membrane. The electrode is left in place on the cell, as in cell-attached recordings, but more suction is applied to rupture the membrane patch, thus providing access from the interior of the pipette to the intracellular space of the cell. This provides a means to administer and study how treatments (e.g., drugs) affect cells in real time.
- Once the pipette is attached to the cell membrane, there are two methods of breaking the patch.
  - The first is by applying more suction. The amount and duration of this suction depends on the type of cell and size of the pipette.
  - The other method requires a large current pulse to be sent through the pipette. How much current is applied and the duration of the pulse also depend on the type of cell. For some types of cells, it is convenient to apply both methods simultaneously to break the patch.
- The advantage is that the larger opening at the tip of the patch clamp electrode provides lower resistance and thus better electrical access to the inside of the cell.
- A disadvantage is that because the volume of the electrode is larger than the volume of the cell, the soluble contents of the cell's interior will slowly be replaced by the contents of the electrode. This is referred to as the electrode "dialyzing" the cell's contents.
  - After a while, any properties of the cell that depend on soluble intracellular contents will be altered. The pipette solution used usually approximates the high-potassium environment of the interior of the cell to minimize any changes this may cause. There is often a period at the beginning of a whole-cell recording when one can take measurements before the cell has been dialyzed.

## In-Class Notes on the Demonstration

![Screenshot of a WeChat Moments post (November 11, 2021, 02:51) with attached electrophysiology images. The post reads (translation): "Attached [Figure 2] Electrophysiology · Single-neuron recording. We didn't rupture the cell membrane, just hoping to observe neural activity at a rougher level. Then because the ion channel blockers couldn't be washed out, we didn't manage to see action potentials — the demo was a bit lonely but still eye-opening haha."](images/pdf2-174.ppm)

![Instagram post from noa_nostalgia (NYU Abu Dhabi): "Wasn't able to see a real-time electrophysiology demo of the single-unit recording in class. The neurons failed to fire properly cuz the ion channels' blockers couldn't be washed away in time. But, still, very interesting & rewarding!!! yatung.1017 🔥🔥" — liked by treedombeibei and 23 others, posted 1 week ago. The post shows images of the electrophysiology setup (microscope, computer screen with recordings) alongside the recording diagram from the lecture.](images/pdf2-175.ppm)

*Note: The in-class electrophysiology demonstration of single-unit recording was attempted but the neurons failed to fire properly because the ion channels' blockers could not be washed away in time. No real-time action potentials were observed, but the demonstration was still considered very interesting and rewarding.*
