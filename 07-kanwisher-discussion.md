## Paper 6: The Fusiform Face Area: A Module in Human Extrastriate Cortex Specialized for Face Perception

---

## Summary of Key Findings

- Identified a region in the **right fusiform gyrus** (fusiform face area, FFA) that responds **selectively and reliably** to faces versus other stimuli.
- Used **blocked fMRI** design.
- Showed significantly greater activation for **intact faces** compared to:
  - Scrambled faces
  - Hands
  - Houses
  - Other objects

---

## Critical Evaluation

### Strength 1: Strong experimental controls

- Used **scrambled faces** as a control condition — equates for low-level visual properties (luminance, spatial frequency) while removing face-specific information.

### Strength 2: Large effect size

- Activation differences between faces and other categories were large and consistent across participants.

### Limitation 1: Blocked design

- Cannot separate adaptation effects from genuine category selectivity.
- Participants might be in a different cognitive "mode" during face blocks.

### Limitation 2: Only right hemisphere FFA reported

- Later studies found bilateral FFA, with right > left asymmetry.

### Limitation 3: Correlation ≠ causation

- fMRI shows correlation between FFA activity and face processing.
- Does not prove FFA is **necessary** for face recognition (lesion evidence or TMS needed).

### Limitation 4: What does "selective" mean?

- FFA responds to faces more than other categories — but also responds (weakly) to objects of expertise.
- Debate: Is FFA a face module or a **general expert object recognition** module?

## The "Face Module" vs. "Expertise" Debate

- **Gauthier et al.**: FFA activated by car experts viewing cars, bird experts viewing birds.
  - Suggests FFA is for **expert individuation** of visually similar objects, not faces per se.
- **Kanwisher et al.**: FFA is specifically for faces.
  - Counter: car/bird expert effects are smaller and inconsistent.

## Implications for Prosopagnosia

- Prosopagnosia patients have damage in/around the FFA.
- Supports FFA as **necessary** for face recognition.
- But: some prosopagnosics have intact FFA activation (suggesting functional differences from structural damage).

## Broader Methodological Points

- **Region of Interest (ROI) analysis vs. Whole-brain analysis**:
  - ROI: more sensitive, but circular if the ROI was defined using the same data.
  - Whole-brain: corrects for multiple comparisons, but less sensitive.
- **The localizer paradigm**: use an independent dataset to define the FFA, then test hypotheses on a separate dataset.
