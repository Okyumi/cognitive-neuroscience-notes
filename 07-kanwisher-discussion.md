## Paper 6: The Fusiform Face Area: A Module in Human Extrastriate Cortex Specialized for Face Perception (The Fusiform Face Area: A Module in Human Extrastriate Cortex Specialized for Face Perception)

**Summary**

Big aim: test the selectivity of face processing; find evidence for the face module (and rule out other possibilities).

**Why choosing the right-handed:**

1. (Trivial) reason: lefties only take up a small portion of the population.
2. Lefties are less consistent (and have more variability) in terms of lateralization.

**Experimental design (for fMRI):**

**Block design**: we do not care about individual objects or faces; we just have tons of stimulation which signals goes up for a long time, and then the HRF will go back to normal. (Will be elaborate in the notes on 20210928.)

**Experimental design (methods):**

| | What the experimenters did | Reasons |
|---|---|---|
| **Part I** | Searched for any occipitotemporal areas that might be specialized for face perception. | (1) Anatomically localize candidate "face areas" within individual subjects. (2) Determine if the regions are activated consistently across subjects. (3) Specify precisely the voxels in the subjects' regions of interest (ROI). |
| **Part II** | Intact two-tone faces vs. Scrambled two-tone faces; Front view of faces vs. Front view of houses | Rule out "low-level features". Rule out "exemplars / subordinate features". |
| **Part III** | 3/4 faces vs. Human hands; Same as above; but "1-back" | (1) If generalize to different viewpoints (directions). (2) If based on hairs (external features). (3) If respond to any animate or human body part. If the former engages more attention than the latter (because more difficult). |

**3.a and 4.a subjects?**

Data are obtained from different participants (because participants might be bored in the block design), so we need to find the occipitotemporal area specialized for facial processing (the FFA) again.

**Signals**: change of activation from baseline (BOLD-processed).

## Critique

**Faces vs. House:**

1. Faces have consistencies of shapes (when we average faces, they are still faces), but houses do not.
2. We are very good individuating faces but not houses.
   - The "face area" not being activated when individuating houses does not necessarily prove that people do not individuate faces.
   - Another point can be that FFA is only the area of expertise.

**1-back:**

Difficulty does not necessarily correlate with attention.

## fMRI Demonstration: In Search of Face Modules in the Brain (No Notes) 2021-09-23

![Social media posts by note author (Chinese): Post about visiting the fMRI machine at NYU Abu Dhabi's Computational Research building — the first and only research fMRI in the Gulf region. Commentary about learning fMRI principles over 1.5 years and finally seeing it in person. Also mentions poor performance on the face-processing task (~20% lower accuracy than peers, attributed to sleep deprivation). Instagram post from noa_nostalgia (NYU Abu Dhabi) with similar content.](images/pdf1-255.jpg)

> *"The Gulf region's first and only research-use functional MRI machine — this is absolutely worth a post.*

> *If it weren't for the pandemic, I probably would have had a chance to see the fMRI machine in my freshman year, and to see it in live demonstration. One and a half years have passed, I've better understood the principles of fMRI, also read more fMRI-related books and papers, and today I finally get to experience it in person, listening to Kartik's clear lectures, experiencing up close the powerful capabilities of the fMRI (scanning the full depths of a human brain in under five minutes, incredible haha).*

> *Attached are also the results of the interesting face processing experiment, as well as my results that were about 20 percentage points lower than my peers — probably because I've been sleep-deprived lately.*
>
> *And celebrating that I finally have my first in-person class. It has been sooooooooooo long!"*
