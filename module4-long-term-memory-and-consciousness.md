## Long-Term Memory I: Cellular and Neural Basis

*Lecture date: 2021-11-18*

### Memory in Broad Terms

**What is a memory?**

> An experience-dependent change in behavior.

- From students: "Resurfacing representation about past events."
  - Counterargument: We do not need resurfacing (recalling) to call something a memory.
- Memory could be representations of external events and internal feelings.

**What is *not* memory?**

- **Storage alone?** DNA is biological storage, but it is not memory.
- **Predictions?** Some argue this is "prospective memory," but most do not regard it as memory.
- **Present experience?** e.g., shivering — based only on present stimuli, not prior experience.
- **Dreaming?** Dreams are built on experiences. This links to the topic of perception: *perception cannot exist without memory, but it is not itself memory.*

**What is a memory system?**

> The set of processes and operations that allow us to encode, store, and recall specific types of information — determined by the functional and structural organization of our brains.

---

### Memory and the Brain

**What is a memory in the brain?**

- **Long-term memory (LTM):** An experience-dependent *structural* change.
- Memory is not merely a *result* of this structural change — it *is* this structural change.
  - Structural changes that are **not** experience-dependent (e.g., developmental or age-related timing-dependent changes in the brain) are **not** memory.
  - Experience-dependent changes that are **not** structural (e.g., changes in activity patterns but not wiring, such as circadian rhythms) are **not** memory.

**Two levels of analysis:**

| Level | Description |
|---|---|
| **Macro-level** | LTM relies on structural change in the **medial temporal lobes (MTL)** |
| **Micro-level** | Memory is a change in the connection between individual neurons (**cellular basis**) |

- **Long-term potentiation (LTP):** One key mechanism by which neurons undergo experience-dependent changes in connection strength.
- LTP-dependent learning/memory requires **NMDA receptors**.

---

### Macro Level: Memory and Brain Damage — Patient H.M.

**Henry Molaison (1926–2008)**

- Underwent bilateral temporal lobectomy to treat severe seizures.
- Result: profound **amnesia**.

**Memory profile:**

- *Relatively spared* remote memory — could remember anecdotes and facts from childhood (e.g., who was president in 1938).
- *Profound* **anterograde amnesia** — unable to form any new LTM. Effectively "frozen in time."

---

### The MTL and LTM

The **medial temporal lobe (MTL)** is critically important for LTM. Key structures and their functions:

| Structure | Function |
|---|---|
| **Lateral ventricle** | Filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) |
| **Thalamus** | Relays motor and sensory signals to the cerebral cortex |
| **Amygdala (A)** | Emotion and memory |
| **Hippocampus (H)** | Learning and memory |
| **Entorhinal cortex (EC)** | Memory, navigation, and time perception |
| **Rhinal sulcus (RS)** | — |
| **Perirhinal cortex (PC)** | Receives highly processed sensory information from all sensory regions; region for memory |
| **Parahippocampal cortex (PHC)** | Memory formation and high-level visual processing (e.g., fusiform cortex) |

---

### Micro Level: LTP as an Example of Memory

- Memory is, specifically, the change in the **connection** between neurons.
- Experimental setup: two neurons (A and B) share a synapse; stimulate A, record from B (can be done in hippocampal slice preparations).
- The strengthening of connection is measured by the fact that the same stimulation of neuron A produces a *greater* response in neuron B after an induction protocol.
  - *Before tetanus:* stimulating neuron A produces ~0.1 mV in neuron B.
  - *After tetanus* (repeated high-frequency stimulations): neuron B responds at ~0.2 mV to the same single stimulation.
    - We do not care about neuron B's response *during* tetanus itself — tetanus mimics the brain process of making the memory.
- This **potentiation** is **long-lasting** (persists for two hours or longer), hence **long-term potentiation**.

---

### NMDA Receptor and Coincidence Detection

*(Notes from Biopsychology)*

The **NMDA receptor** is a glutamate receptor with an Mg²⁺ ion blocking its channel. It acts as a **coincidence detector** because it requires *both* presynaptic and postsynaptic activity to open:

1. **If only neuron A is active:** Glutamate is released and binds to the NMDA receptor, opening the channel — but Mg²⁺ remains stuck, and nothing passes through.
2. **If only neuron B is active:** Positive charge inside the cell electrostatically repels the Mg²⁺ ion, removing the blockade — but the channel remains closed without glutamate.
3. **If both A and B are active simultaneously:** Glutamate binds *and* the postsynaptic depolarization removes Mg²⁺ — the channel opens fully, allowing Ca²⁺ influx. This is the critical event for learning and memory.

**Mechanisms underlying LTP:**

1. High-frequency presynaptic stimulation → co-activation of AMPA and NMDA receptors.
2. NMDA receptor activation → influx of Ca²⁺.
3. Changes via second messengers:
   - **Early-stage:** Increase in AMPA receptors at the postsynaptic membrane.
   - **Early-stage:** Retrograde signaling → increased neurotransmitter release from presynaptic terminal.
   - **Late-stage (permanent):** Gene expression → long-lasting increases in AMPA receptors and new synapse formation.

---

### Detailed LTP Mechanism

*(From a lecture video by Carleton University)*

- **LTP** is the cellular and molecular underpinning of memory: a long-lasting enhancement in signal transmission between two neurons after repeated stimulation.
- The postsynaptic cell carries both **AMPA receptors** (permeable to Na⁺) and **NMDA receptors** (permeable to Na⁺ and, critically, to Ca²⁺; blocked by Mg²⁺ at resting potential).

**Low-frequency stimulation (insufficient for LTP):**

- A small amount of glutamate is released.
- AMPA receptors open briefly → small Na⁺ influx → slight depolarization.
- Glutamate binds NMDA receptor, but Mg²⁺ blockade remains intact — no ion flow.
- This is comparable to studying only briefly: insufficient for LTP.

**High-frequency stimulation (sufficient for LTP):**

- A larger amount of glutamate is released.
- AMPA receptors open longer → larger Na⁺ influx → large depolarization → Mg²⁺ is repelled from the NMDA channel via electrostatic repulsion.
- NMDA receptor opens, allowing Na⁺ and Ca²⁺ influx.
- Ca²⁺ acts as a critical secondary messenger, activating intracellular cascades.

**Two phases of LTP:**

| Phase | Trigger | Mechanism | Duration |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Early phase** | Brief Ca²⁺ increase | Insertion of stored AMPA receptors into postsynaptic membrane | A few hours |
| **Late phase** | Prolonged Ca²⁺ increase | Increased transcription factors → gene expression → new protein synthesis (AMPA receptors, growth factors) → formation of new synapses | 24 hours to a lifetime |

**Key clarifications:**

- LTP is **not** a mechanism — it is an *outcome* of increased activity between two neurons, resulting in more AMPA receptors and stronger synaptic connections.
- The hippocampus is not the only brain region that processes memories; memory processing occurs in many cortical regions.
- Studying activates pathways throughout the brain; continuous activation of the same pathways creates the high-frequency pre- and postsynaptic events that strengthen those connections — the basis of recalling exam material.

### Memory, LTP, and NMDA: Behavioral Evidence

- **AP5** is an NMDA antagonist; pharmacological blockade of the NMDA receptor disrupts LTP.
  - Normal control → LTP achieved.
  - AP5 condition → LTP failed.
  - Inactivated AP5 → LTP achieved.
- **Morris et al. (1986):** AP5 was given to awake, behaving mice in a water maze task.
  - Mice under AP5 could not learn the platform location; upon platform removal, they did not preferentially search the target quadrant.
  - **NMDA blockade disrupts performance on the water maze task** — the behavioral and LTP effects are linked.
  - Cannot learn → unable to change behavior as a function of experience.
- **Conclusion:** NMDA receptor activation is essential for LTM formation.

### Are Distinctions Between Memory Systems Meaningful?

**Working memory (WM) vs. LTM:**

- Patient H.M. could remember lists of ~6 items over a small number of trials (intact WM), but could not form memories for more items regardless of additional trials (impaired LTM).
- This dissociation maps onto brain systems: **MTL** for LTM vs. **dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)** for WM.
- Cellular parallel: long-lasting connection strengthening (LTM) vs. persistent firing without long-term change (WM).

> **Note:** This distinction is not perfectly clean. There is prefrontal involvement in LTM, and hippocampal involvement in WM — but LTM is more **MTL-dependent** and WM is more **prefrontal-dependent**.

**Declarative vs. Non-declarative memory:**

- **Mirror-tracing task (H.M.):** H.M. had no *declarative* memory of ever performing the task — he had to be re-explained the rules on each visit. Yet his *performance improved* across days, showing intact **non-declarative (procedural) memory**.
  - This suggests a dissociation: declarative memory was impaired; non-declarative memory was spared.

**Priming study (double dissociation):**

- Participants (controls, patient M.S. with occipital lesion, focal lesion patients, and amnesia patients) read a list of words, then were shown them briefly and asked to identify them and indicate whether they appeared before.
- **Priming** (non-declarative): faster response to previously seen words.
  - Patient M.S.: *no* priming effect — prior exposure made no difference in speed.
  - Controls, focal lesion patients, and amnesia patients: all showed priming (faster for old than new words).
- **Declarative memory**: accurate recognition of words as old or new.
  - Patient M.S.: intact — recognized ~90% correctly.
  - Amnesia patients: only ~70% correct.

> **Double dissociation:** Amnesia patients show intact non-declarative memory but impaired declarative memory. Patients with occipital lesions show disrupted priming but spared declarative memory.

*(Note: priming does not require repeated exposure; conditioning does.)*

---

### A System-Level View of LTM

**Encoding:**

- How do we study the brain's involvement in LTM encoding?
  - We are constantly encoding facts and experiences into LTM; encoding does not necessarily require attention.
  - Manipulating what gets encoded and what does not is experimentally challenging (more so than WM).
- **Subsequent memory paradigm:** Relate natural variations in LTM to brain activity during encoding (post-hoc sorting).

**Subsequent memory in the brain:**

- Subjects were not told to form LTM. They performed a WM delayed recognition task with novel 3-D shapes, followed by a surprise recall.
- Results were sorted post-hoc: during the WM delay, is there something different about processing for items that were subsequently remembered vs. forgotten?
- Activity during WM delays varied with subsequent memory — recording from **left DLPFC** and **left hippocampus**.
- **Hippocampal activity during the WM delay period predicts incidental encoding into LTM** (more activity early in delay → later remembered).
- This provides evidence for a relationship between WM and LTM encoding.

---

### LTM Storage

- **Consolidation:** The process of strengthening some part of the memory.
- The MTL is unlikely to be heavily involved in the *long-term storage* of LTM:
  - H.M. and other patients with MTL damage could accurately recall facts and events from *before* their damage.
  - **Retrograde amnesia** is common with dementias, which cause widespread *cortical* (not MTL) damage.

| Stage | Structure | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **Initial encoding** | MTL | Encodes and initially stores new information |
| **Transfer** | MTL → Cortex | Transfers consolidated memory to neocortex |
| **Long-term storage** | Neocortex | Stores the LTM |

---

### LTM Retrieval: Interference and Dual-Process Models

**Testing episodic memory — a lab example:**

When recognizing previously seen words, retrieval does not feel the same for all items:

- **Recollection:** "I *remember* having seen that word in the previous list" — retrieval of specific details from the memory episode.
- **Familiarity:** "I *feel like* I have encountered this word before" — a sense of prior encounter without source details.

> Are these meaningfully different in the brain?

---

## Long-Term Memory III: Encoding, Storage, and Retrieval; (Re)consolidation

*Lecture date: 2021-11-29*

---

### System-Level View of LTM: Summary

| Process | Key Brain Structure | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Encoding** | MTL (critical); PFC (also important) | MTL mediates the transfer from WM to LTM |
| **Storage** | MTL → Neocortex | MTL important initially; once consolidated, transferred to neocortex |
| **Retrieval** | MTL + relevant cortical regions | Involves reactivating the neural context of original encoding |

---

### LTM Storage: Evidence and Challenges

**Why evidence for storage is hard to obtain:**

- Memory must be *recalled* to demonstrate storage — the behavior we examine is retrieval, not storage itself.
- Unlike WM, it is difficult to segregate LTM stages in time. (For WM, delay tasks allow temporal separation of encoding, storage, and retrieval.)
  - **TMS** can potentially solve this problem by transiently disrupting processing at specific time points.

**Predictions from the standard model:**

1. Initial recall of LTMs may involve the MTL.
2. MTL damage will affect recall of *recent* memories but not *remote* memories.
   - Patient H.M. had intact remote memory; memories became less intact closer to his surgery date.
3. Damage to neocortex will produce predictable memory deficits for *remote* memories matching the function of the damaged region.
   - e.g., Does FFA damage impair the ability to recall faces?
   - **"The case of the colorblind painter":** Cerebral achromatopsia (damage to area V4 → cortical colorblindness) resulted in an inability to recall color details from remote memories. He knew categorically that "the lawn is green" (semantic knowledge intact) but could not *mentally visualize* green (specific episodic/perceptual detail lost).

---

### MTL-Dependent Recent Memories (Mice Experiment)

- Researchers used **fear conditioning**: pairing a tone with a shock caused mice to freeze.
- Over time, the conditioned stimulus (tone) alone elicited the conditioned response (freezing).
- Experimenters identified a projection from the mice's **PFC to the MTL**.
- Using **optogenetics**, they stimulated the mice's PFC (projecting to hippocampus) in a *different* cage with no tone or shock. The mice froze.
- This was a *recent* memory — MTL-dependent.
- Prediction: once consolidated, the MTL would no longer be required for recall.

---

### LTM Retrieval: Contextual Reinstatement

**Contextual reinstatement:** Recall happens by activating general knowledge about the event and surrounding events.

- "**Mental time travel**" (Tulving)
- Context cues: e.g., the belief that studying in the same room as an exam is beneficial.

**Free recall experiment (fMRI / MVPA):**

- Participants performed an incidental encoding task in an fMRI scanner (famous faces, locations, objects), and then performed free recall several hours later (also in scanner).
- **MVPA** was used to compare activity patterns during encoding and recall for each category.
- Results:
  - Brain activity during *encoding* predicted which *category* the subject was about to recall.
  - The more closely a participant's brain during recall resembled their brain during original encoding, the more likely they were to recall that category.
  - **Reinstating neural context is important for LTM recall.**
  - *(Note: fMRI has time lags; activity patterns are time-shifted.)*

---

### LTM (Re)consolidation

**Why do some memories fade while others strengthen?**

- **Standard model: Consolidation** = the integration of hippocampally-mediated memories into the cortex.
- **Multiple trace theory:** Each instance of retrieval creates a new memory trace; the degree of overlap between traces predicts the transfer from episodic to semantic memory.

**Reconsolidation as new memory:**

Experimental design (3-day study):
- **Day 1:** Learn neutral and negative-emotional images. (Negative-emotional images are naturally better recalled.)
- **Day 2:** Receive placebo or **propranolol** (a beta-blocker that slows heart rate and reduces emotional response); some participants had their memory reactivated, others did not.
- **Day 3:** Test memory for images.

Results:
- Placebo did not affect memory.
- Propranolol only affected memory *when combined with reactivation*.
- If participants formed a new (emotionless) memory of the same item under propranolol, this new trace replaced the emotional one — they no longer showed the faster recall advantage for negative images.

**What is consolidation and reconsolidation?**

- **Consolidation:** The process by which memories are made to persist — conversion from short-term memory (STM) to LTM, involving **protein synthesis** in neurons.
- If protein synthesis is blocked during initial consolidation, LTM does not form.
- Once a fully consolidated memory is **reactivated** (retrieved), it must undergo *another* round of protein synthesis to persist — this is **reconsolidation**.
  - Blocking protein synthesis immediately after retrieval can prevent reconsolidation and disrupt the memory.
- This system exists for **updating memories** in light of new experiences (e.g., incorporating new information about a person you meet again).

| Old view of memory | New view of memory |
|---|---|
| Once consolidated, a memory is retrieved unchanged each time it is used. | Every time a memory is retrieved ("taken out"), it is re-stored as a new version. The next recall uses this updated trace. |

**Clinical implication:**

- Patients could theoretically retrieve traumatic memories while given protein synthesis blockers, dampening the emotional impact of the memory.
- The reconsolidation blockade primarily affects **nonconscious memories** (e.g., those mediated by the amygdala).
- It does not necessarily erase the content or conscious information about the memory — it **dampens the emotional impact**, making it less arousing or troubling.
- This again demonstrates that memory is **context-dependent**.

**Ethical implications of modifying memories:**

- **Potential benefit:** Eliminate traumatic memories (e.g., treatment of PTSD).
- **Potential risk:** Create false memories.

## TMS Demonstration

*Lecture date: 2021-12-07*

---

### Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)

> **TMS** is a method for temporarily and reversibly modulating electrical activity in the brain.

- Operates under the **right-hand rule**, relating electricity and magnetism.
- Logic is similar to lesion studies: observe how TMS changes behavior; infer the causal function of the targeted region.
- TMS can modulate a brain area roughly the size of a small coin, but the signal cannot penetrate deeply.
  - **Limitation for LTM research:** MTL structures (hippocampus, etc.) are too deep to target directly with TMS.

---

### Key Parameters for TMS

**Where to apply the pulse?**

- Everyone's brain anatomy is different.
- Solution: **neuronavigational software** to individualize targeting.

**What intensity to use?**

- Everyone's brain is different.
- Most common approach: base it on **motor threshold** (active vs. resting motor threshold).
- Alternative: **phosphene threshold** (stimulate primary visual cortex; participants report seeing visual flashes).

**What stimulation protocol?**

- How many pulses and in what pattern — different patterns have different effects:

| Protocol | Effect |
|---|---|
| **High frequency (HF)** | Excitatory |
| **Low frequency (LF)** | Inhibitory (mimics a lesion) |
| **Repetitive TMS (rTMS)** | Longer-lasting effects |
| **Single pulse (SP)** | Effect dissipates quickly |
| **cTBS** (continuous theta burst stimulation) | Long-lasting *decrease* in excitability (best for offline inhibition) |
| **iTBS** (intermittent theta burst stimulation) | *Increased* excitability |

- **Online TMS:** Stimulate the participant *during* the experiment.
- **Offline TMS:** Stimulate the participant *before* the experiment (requires long-lasting effects → rTMS, typically cTBS).

**What is an appropriate control?**

- **Within- vs. between-subjects:** Always prefer within-subjects when possible.
- Control conditions:
  - *No TMS* — con: the entire procedure differs from the active condition.
  - *Sham TMS* — coil oriented perpendicularly so the pulse fires but does not reach the brain. Con: participants may perceive the difference.
  - *Vertex TMS* — stimulate a task-irrelevant brain area (e.g., vertex or somatosensory cortex). This is the most common active control.

**Safety considerations:**

- TMS is generally safe but must be used carefully.
- Contraindicated for individuals with a history of seizures or migraines.
- Participants should have eaten beforehand.
- Participants should be warned about potential discomfort or unusual sensations.

---

### Resting-State fMRI (Related Method)

- Used to identify **networks** in the brain by computing correlations of BOLD signals over time.
- Often combined with TMS to define functionally connected regions for targeting.

### Paper 10: Targeted Enhancement of Cortical-Hippocampal Brain Networks and Associative Memory

**Aim:** Investigate cortical-hippocampal interaction via the **lateral parietal cortex (LPC)** and determine whether TMS targeting LPC can enhance associative memory.

---

### Method

**Conditions:**
- TMS stimulation (LPC)
- Sham control
- Negative control (motor cortex)

**Design:**
- Half of participants received stimulation first, half received sham first (counterbalanced).
  - Rationale: removes time-order as a confound.
  - *Critique:* Participants can feel sensory differences between real stimulation and sham. Could differences in outcome be due to the sensation itself rather than the brain effect?
  - *Counter-argument:* At the first time point — before participants were debriefed about which condition they received — the stimulation and control groups were *already* different, suggesting the effect is not merely due to perceived sensation.

**Measure:**
- Accuracy on an **associative memory task** (LTM → declarative → episodic).

---

### Why LPC?

- The hippocampus is too deep to target directly with TMS.
- The experimenters selected an **anatomical seed** in the hippocampus and then targeted a **functionally connected region** — the LPC — via resting-state fMRI.
- Approach: the seed and the target are nodes in the same functional network.

**Individualized targeting procedure:**

1. **Seed (hippocampal ROI):** Researchers selected a hippocampal coordinate that robustly shows functional connectivity with LPC at the group level.
2. **Registered to individual:** Brains were normalized to a common template; the group-level coordinate was then mapped back into each individual's brain. The voxel closest to that coordinate was selected as the seed.
3. **Target (LPC):** Identified using two approaches:
   - *Data-driven:* Resting-state fMRI — search for voxels with high correlation to the seed.
   - *Hypothesis-driven:* Previous literature documenting strong hippocampus–LPC connectivity.

> **Critique:** Ideally, the negative control region should be a site in LPC that has *low* (or no) functional connectivity with the hippocampus, rather than the motor cortex.

---

### Results

**Network connectivity (after 5 days of TMS):**

- **Finding A:** All regions showed *greater* functional connectivity after stimulation relative to sham (increased global networkness).
  - *Critique:* The experimenters did not explicitly report whether there was a clear connectivity change specifically between the seed and the target.
- **Finding B:** After stimulating the LPC (connected to the hippocampal seed), the increase in global brain networkness was *specifically* concentrated in the target region.
  - **High spatial specificity:** Moving only slightly away from the seed showed far less global connectivity change.
  - TMS only affected regions that had a high *baseline* functional connectivity with the seed.

**Memory performance:**

- There was an improvement in memory performance in the stimulation condition relative to sham.
- *Critique:* The therapeutic effect was not long-lasting.
- *Critique:* The study did not differentiate between WM and LTM contributions.
- *Critique:* The task used the same faces throughout (no true forgetting curve), so forgetting might be a major confound.
- **Nuance on the result:** The effect was not a straightforward "improvement" but rather *less worsening* — stimulation attenuated the normal decline in associative memory performance.

## Consciousness I: Different Approaches to the Study of Consciousness

*Lecture date: 2021-12-14*

---

### What is Consciousness?

> "Philosophers have suggested different alternatives: that consciousness should be eliminated from science altogether because it is not a real phenomenon; that consciousness is a real, higher-level physical or neurobiological phenomenon; and that consciousness is fundamentally mysterious and beyond human science."

Consciousness is hard to define in a way that is amenable to scientific study.

**Three core questions:**

| Question | Framing |
|---|---|
| **What** is consciousness? | The mind's subjective experience; the state of being that allows us to subjectively experience the world |
| **Where** is the seat of consciousness? | What are the **neural correlates of consciousness (NCC)**? |
| **How** do we study it scientifically? | Two main approaches: **state-based** and **content-based** |

- *Philosophy:* What does it mean to *be* conscious?
- *Cognitive neuroscience:* Determine systematic forms of information processing and reproducible classes of activation patterns that systematically distinguish "conscious" mental states from other states.

---

### State-Based Approach

**What are different "states" of consciousness?**

- **Coma:** State of unarousable unconsciousness; absence of meaningful eye movements and motor responses (only simple withdrawal reflexes); no coherent verbal response.
- **Persistent vegetative state / Unresponsive Wakefulness Syndrome (UWS):** Unaware of self or surroundings; motor responses are not meaningful; state must persist for more than one month.
- **Anesthesia**
- **Sleep**
- **Dreaming**
- **Intoxication** (e.g., alcohol)

**Core question:** How does brain activity vary as a function of consciousness state?

**From lecture video — key points:**

- Ascending arousal tracks send **glutamate** and **acetylcholine** to the thalamus.
- Disorders of consciousness show large differences in the amount of structural connections — particularly **cortical connectivity** (frontal lobe most notable) — giving rise to conscious functions.
- Stimulating the **reticular activating system** can wake an animal from an unconscious state.
- *Limitation:* Such arousal markers are *necessary* but not *sufficient* for consciousness.

**A challenge to the state-based approach:**

> Our criteria for defining states may not map onto subjective experience.

- A patient in a persistent vegetative state was found to be *more conscious* than previously believed.
- A subsequent study found similar results in approximately **10% of patients** with disorders of consciousness.
- Some such patients were even able to answer **yes/no questions** via modulation of brain activity.
- Conclusion: Defining consciousness by behavioral states alone is not straightforward.

---

### Content-Based Approach

*(Visual neuroscience approach; currently the more popular approach.)*

- Our awareness of our surroundings is not constant — we all experience fluctuations in awareness.
- **Core logic:** Ask participants "did you have a conscious experience?" and compare neural activity on "yes" vs. "no" trials — even when the *physical stimulus* was identical across trials.
- The question: how does brain activity vary with whether a participant reports having a subjective experience, holding the sensory input constant?

---

## Consciousness II: Neural Theories and Psychophysics

*Lecture date: addendum to Consciousness I*

---

### Content-Based Approach: Subjective Experience and V1

**Paradigm:** Participants detected the presence or absence of a near-threshold grating stimulus.

**Key findings:**

- **V1 activity was higher for *hits* vs. correct rejections** (stimulus present and seen vs. stimulus absent and correctly reported as absent).
- **V1 activity was also higher for *false alarms* vs. misses** (stimulus absent but reported as seen vs. stimulus present but not seen).
  - If consciousness were driven purely **bottom-up**, you would expect *low* V1 activity on false alarm trials (no stimulus present).
  - The fact that V1 is *high* on false alarm trials suggests consciousness is **top-down**: the brain follows what it *thinks* is happening, not what is actually happening.
- **Critical finding:** Only **late V1 activity** (re-entrant / feedback) showed a difference between seen and unseen trials — not early feedforward V1 activity.
  - This implicates **feedback (re-entrant) activity to V1** as the neural correlate of conscious awareness, not initial feedforward processing.

> **Candidate NCC:** Re-entrant activity to V1?

---

### Binocular Rivalry and Higher-Order Visual Areas

**Paradigm:** Binocular rivalry between a face (shown to one eye) and a house (shown to the other).
- Task: indicate which percept is currently dominant (face or house).
- Sensory stimulation to each eye remained *constant* throughout.

**Finding:**
- Activity in **FFA** (fusiform face area) and **PPA** (parahippocampal place area) corresponded to the *reported percept*, not the physical stimulus.
- When participants reported seeing the face, FFA was more active; when they reported seeing the house, PPA was more active — despite consistent sensory input to both eyes.

> **Candidate NCC:** Activation of higher-order visual regions?

---

### A Challenge to the Content-Based Approach

> Our behavioral measure of conscious awareness is necessarily subjective. What if it does not accurately reflect the "objective" state of awareness?

- **Criterion bias:** "Conscious" and "unconscious" trials are contaminated in different ways depending on each individual's internal criterion for reporting "seen" vs. "unseen."
  - *(Peters et al., 2016)*
- This means differences between "seen" and "unseen" trials may partly reflect differences in **response bias** rather than differences in *awareness per se*.
