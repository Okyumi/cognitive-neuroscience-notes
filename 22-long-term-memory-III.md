## A System-Level View of LTM

- **Encoding**: the MTL is critical for encoding information into LTM and may mediate the transfer from WM to LTM. (PFC also seems to be important.)
- **Storage**: the MTL is important for initially storing LTM information, but once memory is consolidated, memories are transferred to neocortex for storage.
- **Retrieval**: recalling involves reactivating the neural context in which the memory was encoded and initially stored.
- Below: evidence is in dark blue.

## Encoding

## Storage

- Evidence for storage is challenging:
  - The memory has to be recalled to show storage. The behavior that we examine is recalling, but the predictions of how the participants' recall should change depend on the damages affecting the storage.
  - It is hard to segregate different LTM processes. For WM, you can segregate the stages in time by the delay tasks and study them one by one; however, it is hard to segregate LTM in terms of time, particularly storage in time.
    - The technique TMS (elaborated in the later lectures) could solve such problems.
- Predictions:
  - **Initial recall of LTMs may involve MTL.**
    - The mice experiment shown on the next page.
  - **MTL damage will affect the recall of recent memories but not remote memories.**
    - Patient H.M. has intact remote memory, but his memories fade as they get closer to his surgery.
  - **Damage to neocortex will involve predictable memory deficits in remote memories.**
    - Going to detail:
      - Will there be deficits in memory that exactly matches the functions of cortical regions outside of memory?
      - e.g., Will a FFA damage result in an inability to actually recall faces?
        - Thought question: how can we ask someone who no longer perceive faces if he remembers the faces?
    - "The case of the colorblind painter": cerebral achromatopsia (area V4, cortical colorblindness) and an inability to recall color details from remote memories. For example, he was aware of the fact that "the lawn is green" but he could not image it. He could only give categorical information (semantics) but not the specific color (remote memory also lacks color).

## MTL-Dependent Recent Memories

![Conditioning experiment diagram: (left) cages showing training protocol — mice trained over 14 days pairing tone (BL, IT1–IT5) with shock; 24/48 hrs later tested with tone-only; (right) bar graph showing freezing behavior at CS-pre, US, and CS-post — CS-post bar is elevated, demonstrating conditioned fear response to tone alone](images/pdf2-418.png)

- Researchers used conditioning, pairing a tone with a shock that caused the mice to freeze.
- Overtime, when you continued to pair the tone with the shock, the conditioned stimulus (tone) elicited the conditioned response (freezing behavior).
- Then, the experimenters found a projection from the mice's PFC to the MTL.
- After putting the mice in a different cage, the experimenter, by using optogenetics, stimulate the mice's PFC which projects to the hippocampus. Consequently, the mice froze despite the fact that there was no tone nor shock.
  - This was relatively recent memory, so it was MTL-dependent.
  - We could predict that, once the memory is consolidated, MTL would not be required for recalling the memory.

## Retrieval

- **Contextual reinstatement**: recall happens by activating general knowledge about the event and surrounding events.
  - "Mental time travel" (Tulving)
  - Context clues: e.g., People believe that it is beneficial to study in the same room that they will take the exam in.

*The free recall experiment shown below.*

### Free Recall Experiment

- The researchers had people done the incidental encoding task, presenting famous faces, locations, and objects.
- The participants were in the fMRI scanner during the encoding task and later (several hours later) during the free recall.
- The researchers used MVPA, zooming into participants' different activity patterns for faces, locations, and object.
  - Y-axis: how close the match of the patterns is. (Between the encoding and the recall)
  - Dots: behavior evidence; lines: neural evidence.
- Brain activity measured during encoding predicted which category of item the subject was about to recall, and the results were consistent across subjects.
  - The more the participant's brain looked like how it did when it initially encounter faces/locations/objects, the more likely that it was to start recalling the faces/locations/objects.
  - Reinstating neural context is important for LTM recall.

Colored dots represent Face recall, Location recall, Object recall events. Lines peak near their corresponding recall dots, showing that brain activity pattern at encoding reappears just before the corresponding item category is recalled. Caption: [fMRI has time lags. The activity may be time-shifted.]](images/pdf2-419.png)

## LTM (Re)consolidation

- Some memories fade over time; others are strengthened. Why?
  - Standard model: consolidation is the integration of hippocampally-mediated memories into cortex.
- **Multiple trace theory**: each instance of retrieval creates a new memory trace.
  - The degree to which these are overlapping predicts the transfer from episodic to semantic memory.

## Reconsolidation as New Memory

- Experimental setting:
  - Day 1: learn images (neutral & negative-emotional). Negative-emotional images will be better to recall in nature.
  - Day 2: be given placebo or propranolol (beta-blocker which slows the heart rate and reduces the emotional response); reactivate memory or not.
  - Day 3: test memory for images.

![Experimental timeline diagram: Day 1 (Learning) — images of animals with 24h gap → Day 2 (fMRI) — Pill intake (Placebo/Propranolol, 60min) → Resting state 1 → Reactivation/No-reactivation → Resting state 2 → 24h gap → Day 3 (fMRI, Testing) — "Old or new?" recognition test](images/pdf2-420.png)

- Placebo did not affect memory; propranolol did, but only when it was associated with reactivation.
  - If the participants formed a new memory of the same item with no emotional response due to propranolol, the new memory will be emotionless. They will no longer have faster recalls in negative images.

![Four bar graphs showing accuracy (50–100%) for Neutral vs. Negative memory. Panel B: Placebo no-reactivation — significant difference (negative > neutral). Panel C: Placebo reactivation — significant difference (negative > neutral). Panel D: Propranolol no-reactivation — significant difference (negative > neutral). Panel E: Propranolol reactivation — no significant difference (neutral ≈ negative). Demonstrates that propranolol + reactivation eliminates the emotional memory advantage.](images/pdf2-421.png)

## What is Memory Consolidation and Reconsolidation?

- **Consolidation** is the process by which the memories are made to persist: conversion from the short-term memory (STM) to the LTM.
  - When you have some experience, it goes through the stage of STM, and if it is not consolidated, LTM does not occur.
- The consolidation process involves the protein synthesis in neurons. The proteins collude the memories together.
- Once a memory that is fully consolidated is reactivated or retrieved, it has to go through another phase of protein synthesis in order for that memory to persist in the future.
  - If you block the protein synthesis right after retrieval, you could prevent the storage process and disrupt the memory.
- The above system exists for updating memories in light of new experiences.
  - If you meet a person again, the new things that you learned about that person need to be incorporated into the new memory.
- The old view of memory: once you consolidated a memory, you take it out every time you use it.
- The new view of memory: every time you take a memory out, you have to put it back in, and it is a new memory that you use next time.
- Implication:
  - Treat traumatic experience: theoretically, patients can be asked to retrieve these memories, and the therapists can give the patients some drug that blocks the protein synthesis. The memory could hence be dampened.

- The reconsolidation blockade primarily affects nonconscious memories such as those involved in the amygdala.
- It does not necessarily erase the content or the conscious information about the memory; it only dampens the impact of the memory, making it less arousing/troubling.
  - Again, proving the memory is context-dependent.

## Modifying Memories

![Summary figure illustrating reconsolidation blockade mechanisms and implications for memory modification](images/pdf2-422.png)

- Good(?): eliminate traumatic memories (e.g., PTSD).
- Bad: create false memories!
