### What is Cognitive Neuroscience?

> **Cognitive neuroscience** is neuroscience with direct implications for understanding human behavior, with an emphasis on higher-order functions.

- The question of **construct validity** is important for every domain of behavior in cognitive neuroscience.

> **Construct validity** is the extent to which a measure "behaves" in a way consistent with theoretical hypotheses, and represents how well scores on an instrument are indicative of the theoretical construct.

### Why Study Cognitive Neuroscience?

- There is a vast amount of information available. To learn and value the truth, we must be intelligent consumers of information.
  - We should hold truth in high regard, repeat it, and not allow rumors to distort public understanding.
- The brain is fascinating!
  - e.g., *The Human Fetus Preferentially Engages with Face-like Visual Stimuli.*

### Key Anatomical Terms for Navigating the Brain

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Axial / Horizontal** (transverse) | Cross-sectional plane parallel to the ground |
| **Sagittal** | Plane dividing left and right |
| **Coronal** | Plane dividing front and back |
| **Anterior / Posterior** | Front / Back |
| **Rostral / Caudal** | Toward the head / Toward the tail |
| **Superior / Inferior** | Above / Below |
| **Dorsal / Ventral** | Back side / Belly side |
| **Medial / Lateral** | Middle / Side |
| **Proximal / Distal** | Near (origin) / Far (from origin) |

### Topographic Representation and Somatotopy

- Motor control research introduced the principle of **topographic representation**: adjacent parts of the body are represented on adjacent parts of the cerebral cortex.

> **Somatotopy**: Adjacent parts of the body (e.g., the upper lip and the nose) are represented in adjacent parts of the brain.

### What is a Brain Function?

- Is thinking a brain function? Is eating a brain function? Is eating a cheese sandwich versus a turkey sandwich a brain function?
- **It depends.** What we define as a brain function depends on the level of analysis we are interested in.
- There are virtually limitless sets of behaviors the brain can perform.
  - We may group them into arbitrary, human-defined categories (e.g., eating → decision-making & motor behaviors).
  - We may also parse them into finer-grained analyses (e.g., sandwich → turkey vs. cheese sandwich).
  - But there is a level at which distinctions are useful, and a level at which they become trivial.
- The turkey/cheese distinction does not help us glean more information about how the brain works.
  - When thinking about brain functions, we are looking for a level of grouping that gives genuine insight into how the brain actually works.

### How to Read a Paper

- **If skimming:** Read the first paragraph of the Discussion.
- **If reading for informational purposes:** Read in order.
- **If reading to critically evaluate**, use this order:
  1. Title
  2. References — give an idea of the paper's scope (less useful if unfamiliar with the field)
  3. Abstract
  4. Methods — with context from abstract and references, you should anticipate the experimental approach
  5. Results — with context from methods and abstract, you should anticipate the findings
  6. Introduction
  7. Discussion

### Paper 1: How to Read a Paper (Keshav, 2007) — The Three-Pass Approach

#### First Pass (General Idea)

- **Steps:**
  - Carefully read the title, abstract, and introduction.
  - Read section and sub-section headings only; ignore everything else.
  - Glance at any mathematical content.
  - Read the conclusions.
  - Skim the references.
- **Take-aways:**
  - **Category** — what type of paper is it?
  - **Context** — which other papers does it relate to?
  - **Correctness** — are the assumptions valid?
  - **Contributions** — what are the main findings?
  - **Clarity** — is it well-written?

#### Second Pass (Content)

- **Methods:**
  - Read the paper with care, but skip proofs and fine details.
  - Note unfamiliar terms or questions you may want to ask the author.
  - Examine figures, diagrams, and illustrations carefully.
  - Flag relevant unread references.
- **Outcome:** Grasp the key content and be able to summarize the main argument.

#### Third Pass (Deep Understanding)

- **Key goal:** Virtually re-implement the paper — understand not only its innovations but also its hidden failings and assumptions.
  - Identify and challenge every assumption.
  - Think about how you would present a particular piece of data.
  - Jot down ideas for future work.
- Be able to pinpoint implicit assumptions, missing citations, and potential issues with experimental and analytical techniques.

#### Doing a Literature Survey

1. Use an academic search engine (Google Scholar or CiteSeer) to find 3–5 recently highly-cited papers. A recent survey paper may surface here.
2. Find shared citations and repeated author names in the bibliographies — these identify core papers in the field.
3. Visit the websites of top-cited authors and browse their recent proceedings. If those papers all cite a paper you haven't read, obtain and read it. Iterate as necessary.

### Localization vs. Mass Action

#### Localization of Function
> **Localization**: Mental functions can be localized to circumscribed areas of the brain. Different aspects of brain function (e.g., visual perception, emotion regulation, musical ability) are governed by, and localizable to, different "centers" in the brain.

- **Phrenology (~1820):** Personality is predicted from bumps on the scalp — an extreme application of the localization principle.
- **Lesion studies:** Brain function can be inferred by examining patients with focal brain damage.
- **Neuroimaging (~1990):** Functions can be associated with brain activity measured in behaving individuals.

#### Mass Action
> **Mass action**: Mental functions are distributed across several brain regions. No single area can be thought of as a dedicated "center" for any one function.

- **Equipotentiality** (an extreme perspective): All parts of the brain are equally capable of performing any given function.
- **Lashley and the Engram (~1940):**
  - The *amount* of cortical damage, not the *location*, predicted memory deficits in rats trained to run a maze.
  - Removing increasing amounts of cortical tissue progressively degraded memory; the specific location of removal made no difference.
- **Neuroimaging evidence:**
  - Activity associated with a function can be plastic and distributed.
  - In blind individuals, the occipital lobe is activated during tactile processing.
  - Functional networks span broadly across the brain.

#### Neurological Patient Examples
- **Hydrocephalus:** Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) builds up in the ventricles; affected individuals may have a relatively normal IQ despite dramatic structural change.
- **Traumatic brain injury:** Can result in coma and severely impaired brain function.

### Electrochemical Communication

#### The Action Potential
- Recording electrodes capture action potentials (APs) as discrete **"spikes"** in extracellular recordings.
- **Spike frequency** reflects the activity level of a neuron.

#### Local Field Potential (LFP)
- Because dendritic branches from many neurons are located in close proximity, it is not possible to isolate fluctuations from a single neuron extracellularly.
- The **local field potential (LFP)** reflects the summed post-synaptic potentials of a local population of neurons (i.e., the "dendritic field").
- **LFP amplitude and frequency** reflect the amount of coordinated activity in a neuronal population.

#### Signal Decomposition (Professor's Notes)
- Extracellular electrode recordings contain both LFP and APs combined; they must be filtered to separate them:
  - **High-frequency component** → Action potentials
  - **Low-frequency component** → Local field potential
- When two neurons fire simultaneously, **spike-sorting algorithms** are required to demix the signal and attribute APs to individual neurons.

#### Oscillatory Synchronization
- A neuron receiving different neurotransmitters at different times will have an oscillating membrane potential.
- Across brain regions, **oscillatory synchronization** of neuronal ensembles is necessary for effective inter-regional communication.

### The Lesion Method

> **Craniotomy**: A surgical procedure involving the removal of a portion of the cranium (skull) to expose underlying brain tissue.

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
|------------|---------------|
| The logic behind the method is straightforward. | Challenging to implement; in humans, researchers are "at the whim of nature." |
| Supports strong inferences about the localization of brain function (not just involvement, but **necessity**). | Some types of damage are more common than others (e.g., stroke); no two patients are identical. |
| | Relies on the localization assumption — across individuals and over time. |
| | Does not account for white matter damage. |
| | Finding an appropriate control group is difficult. |

## Lecture 3: Lesion Demonstration
*Date: 2021-09-07*

### Wernicke's Aphasia

> **Wernicke's aphasia**: Inability to assign meaning to language, despite intact language production and motor functions.

- Spared language production, but output typically lacks meaning (fluent but nonsensical speech).
  - A casual listener might not immediately detect the impairment.
- Spared non-linguistic intellectual capabilities and motor functions.
- May display **"press of speech"**: the patient does not pause to allow others to speak.
- May become frustrated *with others* due to limited awareness of their own difficulties.
- Typically caused by damage to the **left posterior superior temporal gyrus** ("Wernicke's area").

### Broca's Aphasia

> **Broca's aphasia**: Partial or complete loss of the ability to produce language, with relatively preserved comprehension.

- More difficulty with verbs than nouns; more difficulty in writing than reading.
- **"Telegraphic speech"**: slow, effortful, word-by-word production.
- Comprehension is largely spared.
- Associated with motor difficulties (not primary motor cortex, but higher-order motor areas).
- May become frustrated *with themselves* and may experience depression, due to awareness of their difficulties.
- Typically caused by damage to the **left posterior inferior frontal gyrus** ("Broca's area").

### Neglect and Extinction

#### Neglect
> **Neglect**: A deficit in the ability to attend to one side of the visual field, despite intact visual perception.

- Patients can see stimuli but have difficulty directing attention toward the contralesional side.
- Can be egocentric (body-centered) or allocentric (object/environment-centered).
- Example: A patient may shave only one side of their face.

#### Extinction
> **Extinction**: Lack of awareness of a contralesional stimulus when it is presented simultaneously with an ipsilesional stimulus.

- With right-hemisphere damage, the patient loses awareness of left-sided stimuli when objects appear on both sides simultaneously.
- Reflects competition between the two hemispheres for attentional resources.
- Associated with **deficits in global processing** — the patient can perceive local details (the "trees") but not the overall whole (the "forest").
- Typically caused by damage to the **right parietal cortex**, resulting in left-field neglect/extinction.

### Additional Observations

- Frontal lobe damage may **release infantile reflexes**, causing patients to revert to primitive reflex patterns.
- **Observation anxiety in lesion patients:** Probably not a significant confound — patients perform normally on tasks associated with their *spared* functions, and their deficits are specific to their impaired domain (though confirmation bias in the examiner remains a potential concern).

### Paper 3: Insensitivity to Future Consequences Following Damage to Human Prefrontal Cortex (Bechara et al.)

#### Critique: Sample Size and Age

- Sample size was relatively small; age groups differed across conditions.
- **Does this invalidate the results?** Not necessarily.
  - Different experiment types have different requirements.
  - For biological (physiological, anatomical) experiments, large samples are not always required to demonstrate an already well-established biological fact. (We do not need to dissect 1,000 people to confirm that humans have two lungs.)
  - Important extension: In monkey lesion studies, a sample size of **n = 2** is typical.
    - The principle: Find biological evidence in the first animal, then replicate in the second. Consistent results are already highly convincing.

#### Critique: Circular Reasoning

- **The core methodological problem:** The authors selected subjects who had *both* prefrontal damage *and* insensitivity to future outcomes, then concluded that prefrontal damage *causes* insensitivity to future outcomes.
- In brain-damage research, where patients are difficult to find, subjects must be selected **blind to the outcome of interest**.
  - Acceptable approach: Select patients with prefrontal damage, without knowing whether they are insensitive to future outcomes, then test them.
  - The issue is not with the results themselves but with the subject-selection process.

#### Critique: Neuroplasticity and Timing

- The authors should specify **how long the brain damage had existed** at the time of participation.
- Due to neuroplasticity, failure to specify the timing of damage introduces a potential confounding variable.

#### Strength: Multiple Control Groups

- The authors used patients with brain damage in *other* regions, alongside neurologically intact controls — two control groups.
- This rules out the possibility that damage to non-prefrontal regions caused the observed results.
- **Limitation:** The authors should have attempted to control for the *size* of the lesion (though this is methodologically difficult). Without this control, lesion size is a potential confound.

#### Note on Presentation

- The authors introduced a **completely new viewpoint in the Discussion** section. This practice is not recommended but is not a serious flaw.

---

### Dissociation: Key Concepts

- In this experiment, insensitivity to future outcomes could reflect impaired **decision-making** (as the authors claim) or could be attributable to other causes, such as **working memory impairment**. The authors have an obligation to distinguish between these possibilities, or to note the ambiguity as a direction for future research.

#### Single Dissociation

> **Single dissociation**: Brain area 1 supports function A but not function B.

- Example: If the damaged prefrontal region is shown to be associated with decision-making but *not* working memory, this constitutes a single dissociation — making the conclusions more rigorous.

#### Double Dissociation

> **Double dissociation**: Brain area 1 supports function A but not function B, *AND* brain area 2 supports function B but not function A.

- Example: If the damaged prefrontal region handles decision-making (not working memory), *and* a different brain area handles working memory (not decision-making), this is a double dissociation.
- Double dissociation provides the **strongest explanatory power** and the greatest methodological rigor.
